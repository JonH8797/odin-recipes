<h2> Description</h2>
<p> I'm known for being the dip goddess among my friend group. Years ago, when questioning why my dips were just *so* good, 
    I pinpointed the reason: the trifecta of cream cheese, mayo, and sour cream. 
    The mayo is essential to any delicious baked dip; it's super creamy, rich, and fatty, with a silky texture. 
    Sour cream you don't need much of, but it adds a tang that you'll miss if you skip it. And cream cheese is the cornerstone of any baked dip. 
    Typically one block will do the trick.</p>
<p> Spinach dip included! We like to add it especially when we're making this dip for the holidays. The smoky bacon bits make baked spinach dip feel a little fancier. But you can totally skip it. 
    This dip has a lot going on with three different cheeses; no one will miss the bacon.Cream cheese is non-negotiable, but you also need some melty cheese that can bring the flavor. 
    We always turn to mozzarella for dip because it's mild-tasting and super melty.(Also, who doesn't like mozzarella?!) And then we choose another cheese that packs a little more punch,
     some sharpness or saltiness.Parmesan is best here, but white cheddar is what makes many baked dips shine.</p>

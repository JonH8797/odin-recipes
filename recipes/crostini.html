<h2> Description</h2>
    <p> Quick and easy recipe for making your own crostinis. All you need is one fresh baguette! </p>

<h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 baguette (crusty French bread) </li>
        <li> 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, as needed </li>
        <li> Flaky sea salt or fine salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
<h4> Steps </h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven (or a gas grill) to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. 
             Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy clean-up, if desired.
             If your baking sheet is smaller than mine, you may need to make the toast in two batches. </li>
        <li> Slice your baguette on the diagonal into pieces no wider than 1/2 an inch. I can usually fit 20 to 24 on my larg baking sheet;
            you might have some bread left over. Lightly brush both sides of each slice with olive oil (this will require about 2 to 3 tablespoons oil).</li>
        <li> Place the slices in a single layer on your prepared baking sheet and bake them on the middle rack for 6 to 9 minutes, until they're nicely golden on top.
            Sprinkle the toasts lightly with salt. Transfer the toasts to a serving platter, if desired, and use as desired. Refresh yourself with a nice <a href="./texas-ranch-water.html"> Texas Ranch Water!</li>
